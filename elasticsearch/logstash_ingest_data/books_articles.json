Sedaris finds inspiration in daily life — wearing a Fitbit, picking up trash, visiting his North Carolina beach house, the Sea Section. (He recently bought the house next door to the Sea Section, telling Money magazine, “We’re going to either call it the Amniotic Shack or Canker Shores.”) “In a lot of the stories nothing huge happens,” Sedaris says. “I spent a week at the beach with my family, but it wasn’t like anybody got into a car accident or someone broke into the house and stole things. But it still felt like a story to me. You know, how life feels like a story.”", "pub_date": "2018-06-08T09:00:10+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "BookReview", "section_name": "Books", "subsection_name": "Book Review", "type_of_material": "List", "word_count": 443, "byline_original": "By Tina Jordan", "headline_main": "Everything Is Copy", "scope": "books", "searchitem": "Karen Kingsbury"}, {"id": "nyt://article/45ca619d-12cb-5b92-aa57-6d839d0fb1ff", "search_id": "bks2023102015400519", "abstract": "Shot as a tribute to David Cronenberg, it makes its U.S. premiere at David Zwirner gallery tonight.

The book is, no surprise, every bit as rowdy as the movie. Haddish grew up in foster care in South Central Los Angeles, and for a time had a job as an “energy producer” at bar mitzvahs, where she was paid to dance enthusiastically and encourage other guests to have a good time. (“I was basically the Flava Flav of bar mitzvahs.”) In one memorable chapter, she explains how that gig led to a sideline pimping out her male friends. “If you’re doing bar mitzvahs, you’re going to meet old Jewish ladies,” she writes. “They started telling me how lonely they were and saying things like, ‘My husband’s not satisfying me.’” When one woman showed Haddish her collection of romance novels — “She had one that was like a slave thing or whatever. It was a big, strapping black guy on the cover, holding this passed-out white woman” — Haddish was inspired. “I don’t know any slaves,” she told the woman, “but I could probably hook you up with somebody big and strong.” Word spread, and Haddish thrived until the men realized they could cut their own deals without her. That’s O.K. She’s found other ways to put her people skills to lucrative use. On the copyright page, her publishers suggest stores file the book under “Biography and autobiography / Rich and famous.”", "pub_date": "2017-12-15T10:00:23+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "BookReview", "section_name": "Books", "subsection_name": "Book Review", "type_of_material": "List", "word_count": 449, "byline_original": "By Gregory Cowles", "headline_main": "Tiffany Haddish on Bar Mitzvahs, Pimping and Other Rites of Passage", "scope": "books", "searchitem": "Karen Kingsbury"}, {"id": "nyt://article/12a4a9f3-f6b3-539b-875f-4469ab8b1137", "search_id": "bks202310201540056", "abstract": "1.

Feehan discovered her calling while she was still in middle school; speaking with the romance website RBL Romantica early in her career, she remembered sitting in math class and working on her first steamy love scene until the teacher confiscated her notebook. “You should have seen his face,” she said. “I was about 13 at the time. I don’t know which of us was more mortified.” But despite her early start she delayed publishing for a long time, working more than 20 years as a martial arts instructor (she has a third-degree black belt in karate) and writing for herself while she and her husband raised 11 children. “I can write with the entire household around me most of the time,” she told another website in 2002. “My husband reads all my books and had better love them — and if he doesn’t, he’d better lie like crazy with a smile on his face.

This is a good time of year to think about growing ferns in the garden. They are not difficult.  As many as 200 species are native to the temperate United States and they can be found dispersed over a wide range of habitats. If a fern garden is on the list of landscaping projects, decide the type. Ferns thrive in bogs, marshes, moist woods, along rocky slopes. A few are at home in desertlike terrain. Many will adapt to a range of habitats, but most prefer an environment that is created with chosen habitats in mind.   When selecting the type of habitat, study the piece of land to see what it offers naturally. Traits of a garden site can often be modified to meet the needs of more demanding species. However, if fern species are selected that are compatable with the natural characteristics, the results will require less care and provide greater satisfaction.", "lead_paragraph": "Cool greens, soft fronds and dappled shade are a summer's oasis from the oppressive heat of a July afternoon.

But the work didn’t always come easy. “When I started out 35 years ago,” she told a newspaper in Savannah, Ga., recently, “I saw a quote from Phyllis Whitney: ‘There has never been an easy time to sell a book.’ I wanted this more than I ever wanted anything in my life. I got rejected so fast, my manuscripts would hit me in the back of the head on my way back from the post office.” But Macomber never gave up. “It has a lot to do with stubbornness and desire,” she said, adding that she similarly trained herself to run despite a lack of athletic ability.
