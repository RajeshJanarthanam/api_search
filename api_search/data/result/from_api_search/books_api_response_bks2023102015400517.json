The story, written by Grant Morrison, was presented as \"the day evil wins,\" even though we know, c'mon, the heroes are going to be victorious in the end. \"Final Crisis\" features the return of a long-dead hero, the death of another and a whole lot of parallel earths, where, say, Batman is a vampire; Superman's rocket landed in the Soviet Union; or Wonder Woman is a villain known as Superwoman. No one handles those endless possibilities better than Mr. Morrison, as he proves again in \"Final Crisis\" (particularly in the final issue in the collected edition) and in the two-part series \"Superman Beyond,\" which is wisely included in the hardcover. A peek at some pages from the comic \"Final Crisis\" is available here. And for a hint at what Mr. Morrison has planned next for the multiverse, click here.",

The rest is history: he became a comic book fan and, he writes, he always pictured the Dresden character as a comic book hero. Now he is one.",

The story, written by Grant Morrison, was presented as “the day evil wins,” even though we know, c’mon, the heroes are going to be victorious in the end. “Final Crisis” features the return of a long-dead hero, the death of another and a whole lot of parallel earths, where, say, Batman is a vampire; Superman’s rocket landed in the Soviet Union; or Wonder Woman is a villain known as Superwoman. No one handles those endless possibilities better than Mr. Morrison, as he proves again in “Final Crisis” (particularly in the final issue in the collected edition) and in the two-part series “Superman Beyond,” which is wisely included in the hardcover. A peek at some pages from the comic “Final Crisis” is available here. And for a hint at what Mr. Morrison has planned next for the multiverse, click here.",
